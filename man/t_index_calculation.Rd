\title{Calculates time-dependent index when nodes weights or barriers passability are changing}
\usage{
t_index_calculation(
  graph = graph,
  ...,
  barriers_metadata,
  id_barrier = "id_barrier",
  year = "year",
  pass_u = "pass_u",
  pass_d = "pass_d",
  weights_metadata,
  weight = "length",
  nodes_id = "name",
  parallel = TRUE,
  ncores
)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{an object of class igraph. Can be both directed or undirected.}

\item{...}{other arguments passed to the function index_calculation}

\item{barriers_metadata}{data.frame that must contain a column having the same name as the 'id_barrier' attribute of the graph,
and two columns with the corresponding upstream and downstream improved passabilities (see pass_u and pass_d), and a column with the year
passability was changed. This data frame can be obtained from easily-formatted data with the function \code{t_passability_sequencer}.}

\item{id_barrier}{graph edges attribute used to label barriers. Default is \code{"id_barrier"}. It should be present in the 'barriers metadata' input as well.}

\item{year}{field of the 'barriers metadata' where temporal information on the changes in passability is stored.}

\item{pass_u}{field of the 'barriers metadata' where temporal-dependent upstream passability is stored.}

\item{pass_d}{field of the 'barriers metadata' where temporal-dependent downstream passability is stored.}

\item{weights_metadata}{data.frame that must contain a column having the same name as the 'nodes_id' attribute of the graph,
a column with he corresponding weight information (see 'weight' parameter), and a column with the year
weight was changed. This data frame can be obtained from easily-formatted data with the function \code{t_weight_sequencer}.}

\item{weight}{param weight graph vertex attribute used to assign weights to the reaches (nodes). Default is \code{"length"}.}

\item{nodes_id}{graph vertex attribute used to uniquely label reaches (nodes). Default is \code{"name"}.}

\item{parallel}{logical value to flag if parallel option is to be used.}

\item{ncores}{define how many cores are used in parallel processing. Active only when \code{parallel = TRUE}}
}
\value{
a data.frame with a 'year' field and related connectivity index.
If \code{index_type = "reach"}, the data.frame is organized by 'year' and 'name'.
